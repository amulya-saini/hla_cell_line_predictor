# hla_cell_line_predictor
Python algorithm developed to predict the minimum number of cell lines required from Coriell.org to cover all the HLA haplotypes requested by a client. This algorithm is designed to streamline the process of selecting and purchasing the appropriate cell lines for HLA typing studies.

The algorithm leverages the power of pandas, a popular data manipulation library in Python, to efficiently process and analyze the HLA haplotype data. By taking into account the client's specific HLA requirements, the algorithm determines the optimal combination of cell lines that can provide comprehensive coverage.

The hla-cell-line-predictor repository contains the source code and resources for the HLA Cell Line Predictor algorithm. It provides a comprehensive solution for predicting the minimum number of cell lines required to cover specific HLA haplotypes. The repository includes the Python script implementing the algorithm, along with sample data and usage instructions.
